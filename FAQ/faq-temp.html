  <h4>Basic Overview</h4>
  <h5> TL;DR: Invent a character, explore a fantasy world, talk to the people living there,
    fight crazy monsters, acquire plunder and glory, roll dice, drink beers,
    yell at your friends and have fun. </h5>
  <h6> Dungeons and Dragons is a fanstasy role playing game. The game is
    playes by 2-4 player characters, who paly as adventurers exploring a world,
    and one Dungeon Master, who controls the context of the adventure and plays as the
    non-player characters and monsters </h6>

  <h4>Rules</h4>
  <h6>There are very fules to the game, so creativity and ingenuity are reawrded.
    The players will be placed into challenging situations,
    (such as fighting an army of monsters, discovering and deciphering mysterious
    clues, and interrogating, seducing and deciving non-player characters),
    and will have to use their imaginations to device ways to overcome those
    challenges. </h6><br>

  <h4>Mechanics</h4>
  <h6>The primary mechanic of the game is the roll of a 20-sided dice known as a D20.
    Players state what they wnat to do (for instance,<h5>"I want to use the rope
      to swing across the chasm"</h5>), and then roll a D20.</h6><br>
  <h6>The Dungeon Master decides to himself how difficult the task is (out of 20),
    and if the dice scores higher than the humber hten the player succeeds, and if
    not then they fail. The Dungeon Master then narrates the reult of the action
    (<h5>"You try to swing across the gaping chasm, but your grip slips half-way across,
      and you fall to the canyon floor. You take two damage. You see glowing eyes
      in the darkness</h5>")</h6><br>

  <h6>Natural rolls of 1 and 20 result in spectular failures and sucess, respectivley.</h6><br>

  <h4>Goals</h4>
  <h6> The goal of the game is simply to play the game, because its fun!</h6><br>
  <h6>Generally, the Dungeon Master is trying to steer you onto a fun quest, but ultimately, it's
    all up to you. Want to start a peasant revolt against the evil king? Go ahead! Want to turn
    a dragon into your pet and become the ruler of the land? Roll for it! Want to start a seedy
    brothel? Uh, sure! </h6><br>
  <h6>The only limits are your imagination and the rolls of dice. Have fun! </h6><br>

  <h4>Making Characters</h4>
  <h5>TL;DR: Choose a character type. "USE OUR CHARACTER MODULE". In a pinch,
    pretend to be Han Solo or Darth vader but as a Lord of the Rings Character.</h5>
  <h6>Every palyer besides the Dungeon Master needs to create a character.
    This will be something like "Riceak Beestinger", "Chaotic Gnomish Druid, Or Hollyatra Gellantara",
    "Lawful Human Palladin". </h6><br>
  <h6>Each player will need to choose a race, class, an alignment, and a name. "Use our character
    sheet module to set that up"</h6><br>
  <h6>You'll probably wnat to make sure that your party has good a balance of skills and
    personalitites. You can ALL be Han Solo!</h6><br>
  <h6>If you're super lazy, just these characters for your party, which should suit any
    starting campaing</h6>
    <p> at this point i would include hyperlinks to pre-created Characters
      that players could use</p>

  <h4>Race</h4>
  <h6>TL;DR:<h5>What do you look like</h5></h6><br>
  <h6>Race defines the general physical characteristics of your character.</h6><br>
  <h6>Race can affect how people interact with your character. Non-player Characters
    in the games may have their own racial prejudices - for instance, if yourgo to a Dwarven Cave
    the Dwarves there might be racist towards your Elf Playert. This can lead to some funny
    situations.</h6><br>
  <h6>Also, big characters can throw small characters, which is also funny :).</h6>
