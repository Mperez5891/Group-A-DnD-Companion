												<h3 class="text-white mb-3">Rules</h3>
												<p class="text-white-50">Most of the rules are built into the app, but here's what you need to know</p>

												<h3 class="text-white mb-3" style="text-align:left">Game Mechanics</h3>
												<p class="text-white-50" style="text-align:left">
													The primary mechanic is the rolling of dice. A D20 (twenty sided dice) is used to determine the outcome of events.
													Whether it be swinging across a broken bridge, fighting a monster thats blocking your path, or convincing a NPC to tell you where the treasure is.
													You make a call, roll the dice, and the Dungeon Master narrates your outcome.
												</p>

												<h3 class="text-white mb-3" style="text-align:left">Character Creation</h3>
												<p class="text-white-50" style="text-align:left">
													Creating a character is something you might want to do before joining a session to save some time(optional)<br><br>
													&#149; Race<br>
													First and foremost is choosing your characters' race. There is a variety to choose from, such as Orc, Human, or Drawf.
													This is important to determine the general characteristics of your character, from you physical traits to how you interact with the world.<br><br>
													&#149; Class<br>
													You can choose from Cleric, Druid, Monks, Wizard, Warlocks, and more. This will define your abilities and skills.<br>
										 			For example, choosing the Fighter Class will have the quality of Combat and, of course, be good at fighting.<br><br>
													&#149; Alignment<br>
													This will be the base for your characters motivations and behavior. Are you Neutral Evil? Lawful Good? Perhaps, Chaotic Evil?<br>
													Choose among the two axis: Good to Evil & Lawful to Chaotic.<br><br>
													&#149; Name<br>
													Last but not least, choose your name! Make if funny, serious, or witty, its really up to you! Just remember that the Dungeon Master
													will have players call each other by character names. If you're having trouble deciding you could always just use a name generator.<br><br>

													Lucky for you, this is all handled by our Character Suite!
												</p>

												<h3 class="text-white mb-3" style="text-align:left">Things To Keep in Mind About Your Character</h3>
												<p class="text-white-50" style="text-align: left">
													You're going to have different Hit Points(HP), Armor Class(AC), and abilitiy modifiers, which depend on your character choices + the D20.
												</p>

												<h3 class="text-white mb-3" style="text-align:left">Gameplay</h3>
												<p class="text-white-50" style="text-align:left">
													The Dungeon Master will start it off by reading an introductury narrative about the world. It could be the environment, possible tasks/adventures
													or even NPCs surrounding you.
													The group will choose a player to start with and decide the turn rotation. Sometimes a player will speak for the group and times each inividual can choose what they want to do.
													It all depends on how you want to play the game. <br><br>
													Which brings us to the following: Exploration, Interaction, and Combat.<br><br>
													&#149; Exploration<br>
													When there are no NPCs or Monsters around, your primary objective is to explore your environment. Your search will help
													you find clues, uncover puzzles, or discover items. You can use what you learn about your surroundings to solve puzzles, find treasures, create diversions, tame animals, and much more <br><br>

													&#149; Interaction<br>
													When you encounter Non-Player-Characters (NPCs) they might have something you need, and theres only one way to find out if they have it.<br>
													Actually, there are a lot of ways to find out.<br><br>
													Here are a few:<br>
													- Interogation<br>
													- Threats<br>
													- Bribery<br>
													- Kidnapping<br>
													- Torture<br>
												 	Have your group use its collective imagination to decide what is necessary! (FOR GROUP A, im not sure how iteractions go so some help in this part would be great)<br><br>

													&#149; Combat<br>
													Here we have another great use for the D20; roll to see if your attack lands, roll again to check how much damage you did.<br>
													There is more to it, however, the Dungeon Master must keep track of the players time during a turn, player positioning, and a characters combat type (melee, range, magic).
													Keeping track of this should help the combat portions run naturally.<br><br>
													There are a few other things to keep in mind about combat...<br><br>
													- Attacking<br>
													To attack, a player must declar a target and the weapon/action they choose to attack with.<br>
													Then, roll a D20(+ the attack bonus for the chosen weapono). If your number is greater than or equal to your enemies Armour Class, the attack has hit.
													If it does, you will roll another dice (depending on your weapon), and calculate the damage dealt.<br>
													Optionally, the Dungeon Master can narrate what goes down in combat.<br><br>
													NOTE: Natual 1s and Natural 20s result in self-inflicting wounds and damage strikes, respectively. <br><br>

													- Defending<br>
													Same as attacking, just that this time, the Dungeon Master rolls for the enemy against the player.<br><br>

													- Death<br>
													Simple, if a players HP drops below 0, they can no longer attack. You can get a roll to try and stuff your guts back in or whatever your imaginationon conjurs up,
													 as well as be carried out of danger by a fellow player. <br>
													 Actual death (as in, you can't play anymore), is completely up to the group to decide. You can decide to hang out as a ghost and interact with the world if you so desire.<br><br>

													- XP and Levels<br>
													After winning a round of combat, you will receive Experience Points that go toward your level. Receive enough points and level up by 1.<br>
													Leveling up allows you to upgrade their abilities and improve HP. <br>
													Leveling up happens at 300, 900, 2700, 6500, 14000, 23000, 34000, 48000, 64000, 85000, 100000, 120000, 140000, 165000, 195000, 225000, 265000, 305000 and 355000 points.<br><br>
												</p>

												<h3 class="text-white mb-3" style="text-align:left">Dungeon Master</h3>
												<p class="text-white-50" style="text-align:left">
													Last but not least...<br><br>
													Your job as Dungeon Master is to help players have as much fun as possible.<br>
													Aside from making sure everyone follows the rules, it's also your responsibility to set them up. Along with the setting, environment, NPCs, and enemies.
													<br><br>
													Don't worry, we have all the tools you'll need.
